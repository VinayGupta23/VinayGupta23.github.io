Working part-time under a PhD student as an engineer to help improve interactions in XR.
 - Port input controller from device-based to [action-based system](https://github.com/powenyao/XR-Interaction-Toolkit-Examples/wiki/Design:-Locomotion-System) in Unity
 - Implemented [state machine and input manager](https://github.com/powenyao/XR-Interaction-Toolkit-Examples/wiki/Design:-Controller-Manager) in C# for customizable locomotion
 - Helped develop a demo for submission to [SIGGRAPH 2023](https://s2023.siggraph.org/program/immersive-pavilion/)
