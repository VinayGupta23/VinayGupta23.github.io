Working part-time under a PhD student as an engineer to help improve interactions in XR.
 - Port input controller from device-based to <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/powenyao/XR-Interaction-Toolkit-Examples/wiki/Design:-Locomotion-System">action-based system</a>
 - Implemented <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/powenyao/XR-Interaction-Toolkit-Examples/wiki/Design:-Controller-Manager">state machine and input manager</a> for customizable locomotion
 - Helped develop a demo for submission to <a target="_blank" href="https://s2023.siggraph.org/program/immersive-pavilion/">SIGGRAPH 2023</a>
