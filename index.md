Hi, I'm Vinay Gupta, a **masters student in Computer Science at USC**. Video games hold a special place in my heart, and I recently (or perhaps, finally!) switched my career focus to game development!

This work-in-progress site hosts my **personal portfolio** of endeavours in the field of gaming. If you're interested to connect, contact me using the options in the footer below.

## How does my prior experience help?

        {% include chip.html tag="Multithreading" %}
        {% include chip.html tag="SIMD" %}
        <p>I developed features for the 5G protocol stack that runs frame-to-frame, on multithreaded systems, using <strong>event-driven architecture</strong> and SIMD processing - similar to games!</p>

        {% include chip.html tag="MVVM" %}
        {% include chip.html tag="CI/CD" %}
        {% include chip.html tag="Perforce" %}
        <p>Keen on improving things around me and aiding productivity, I've worked on test <strong>automation workflows</strong>; data analysis; GUI & CLI utilities; and more!</p>

I've come to realize that many of these skills can translate to game development, and I'm eager to learn and grow further!
