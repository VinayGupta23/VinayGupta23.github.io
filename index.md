Hi, I'm Vinay Gupta, a **masters student in Computer Science at USC**. Video games hold a special place in my heart, and I recently (or perhaps, finally!) switched my career focus to game development!

This work-in-progress site hosts my **personal portfolio** of endeavours in the field of gaming. If you're interested to connect, contact me using the options in the footer below!

## How does my prior experience help?

        <h3>Low-level (2 years)</h3>
        {% include chip.html tag="C++" %}
        {% include chip.html tag="OOP" %}
        {% include chip.html tag="Multithreading" %}
        {% include chip.html tag="SIMD" %}
        <p>Worked on 5G protocol stack that, like games, runs frame-to-frame, on multi-core systems, using event-driven architecture and SIMD processing. For instance, I implemented custom memory allocators (bitmap-based, ring buffers), and resolved complex race conditions using atomic operations.</p>

        {% include chip.html tag="Python" %}
        {% include chip.html tag="MVVM" %}
        {% include chip.html tag="UX" %}
        {% include chip.html tag="CI/CD" %}
        {% include chip.html tag="Perforce" %}
        <p>Keen on improving things around me and aiding productivity, I've worked on test automation workflows; dependency analysis to optimize build sizes; bug detection using state machines; and version control scripting & mentoring.</p>

I've come to realize that many of these skills translate well to game development, especially game engines!
