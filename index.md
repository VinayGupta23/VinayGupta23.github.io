Hi, I'm Vinay Gupta, a masters student in Computer Science at USC. Video games hold a special place in my heart, and I recently (or perhaps, finally!) swtiched my career focus to game development!

Prior to my masters, I was a senior engineer working on multi-core embedded systems for 5G networks. I've come to pleasantly realize that there are many parallels between the two, especially in the context of game engines - real-time frame-to-frame processing, C++, memory management, multithreading, SIMD (parallel computing), linear algebra, ...the list goes on.

This site hosts my personal portfolio of projects and endeavours in the field of gaming. If you're interested to connect with me, shoot me an email or send me a request on LinkedIn using the links below!
