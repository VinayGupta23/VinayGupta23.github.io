# About

Hi, I'm Vinay Gupta, a **masters student in Computer Science at USC**. Video games hold a special place in my heart, and I recently (or perhaps, finally!) switched my career focus to game development!

This work-in-progress site hosts my **personal portfolio** of projects and endeavours in the field of gaming. If you're interested to connect with me, contact me using the options below!

Prior to my masters, I was a senior engineer working on **real-time multi-core embedded systems** for 5G networks.

I've come to pleasantly realize that there are many parallels between the two, especially in the context of **game engines** - frame-to-frame processing, C ++, memory management, multithreading, SIMD (parallel computing), linear algebra ...and so on.
